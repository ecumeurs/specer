### Context

### Aim

### Architectural Stack

The system operates on a strict three-tier separation of concerns to ensure simulation integrity and client responsiveness.

| Layer | Responsibility | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Engine** | State production, delta computation, and "Heartbeat" simulation. | Absolute (Source of Truth) |
| **The Controller** | ACL validation, "What-If" forecasting, and contract brokerage. | Logical (Gatekeeper) |
| **The UI** | Diegetic visualization, forecast HUDs, and command buffering. | Visual (Presentation) |

#### Communication Flow

1. **The Forecast Loop:** UI requests a simulation from the Controller -> Controller queries Engine state -> Controller runs local "What-If" logic -> UI renders "Ghost Bars."
2. **The Command Loop:** UI sends batch instructions -> Controller validates funds/ACL -> Controller issues authoritative command to Engine -> Engine updates State.

### Feature: World Engine

#### Context, Aim & Integration

The Engine is a headless simulation environment that manages the world state without awareness of player identities, focusing solely on **Entities** and **States**.
