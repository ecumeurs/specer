# Static Frontend UI
The browser-based interface for interacting with the Specer tool.

## Drive
Requirement for a user-friendly interface to manage the "Protocol" flow, visualize structure, and review/merge changes generated by the LLM.

## Planned usage
* **Target Audience**: Architects and developers using Specer to refine specifications.
* **User Stories**:
    * As a user, I want to paste an LLM response and have it parsed into chunks.
    * As a user, I want to review the proposed merge for a specific section against the original.
    * As a user, I want to edit the merged result before committing.
    * As a user, I want to stop a long-running generation process.
    * As a user, I want to click a Feature section and generate a concise AI summary stored in a `#### Summary` subsection at the top.

## Business Logic
* **Protocol Parsing**: The frontend sends raw text to the backend to parse "Protocol Blocks".
* **Merge Workflow**:
    1. Parsing identifies chunks.
    2. Chunks are queued in `pendingMerges`.
    3. User selects a chunk -> triggers background "Diff/Merge" generation (LLM).
    4. User reviews "Original" vs "New" vs "Proposed Merge".
    5. User commits -> updates Document Structure and saves to disk.
* **Structure Management**: Maintains a tree view of the document.

## Expectation & Achievement
* [x] Protocol text processing.
* [x] Structural visualization.
* [x] Merge review and commit.
* [x] Stop button for long-running tasks.
* [x] Feature summary generation via Ollama (`#### Summary` subsection, 100–200 words).
* [ ] Rich text editor (currently textarea).
* [ ] HTML Preview
