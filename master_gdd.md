**Status:** Living Document / KISS 
**Core Hook:** One Universe, Three Perspectives.

---

## 1. THE SHARED UNIVERSE (Narrative & Vibe)
*The "Soul" that remains constant regardless of which app is open.*

### 1.1 The High Concept
> "Survival on a reality-unstable planet where corporate greed, shadow warfare, and frontline survival are one and the same."

### 1.2 Design Pillars (The "Golden Rules")
* **Interdependence:** No app is an island.
* **Friction as Value:** Complexity and loss are part of the progression.
* **Verticality:** Everything moves from the "Wild" (T1) to the "Core" (T10).

## 2. THE ECOSYSTEM ECONOMY (The "Flow")
*How value moves between the three separate games.*

### 2.1 Global Resource Map
* **Primary Resource (Matter):** Extracted in *Commerce*, used for gear in *Battle*.
* **Secondary Resource (Intel):** Generated in *Intrigue*, provides buffs in *Battle*.
* **Tertiary Resource (Security):** Generated in *Battle*, lowers "Reality Glitch" rates in *Commerce*.

### 2.2 The Global State Machine
* **Volatility:** When *Battle* players fail, Volatility rises across all apps.
* **Prosperity:** When *Commerce* players thrive, funding for *Intrigue* missions increases.

## 3. THE "TRI-PLAYER" JOURNEY
*Defining the different ways a player can engage with Upsilon.*

* **The Specialist:** How the game accommodates a player who *only* plays Battle.
* **The Generalist:** How the game rewards switching between all three apps.
* **The Synergy Mechanic:** (e.g., "The Flash/Commendation" that impacts all three modules).

---

## 4. SHARED LEXICON & AESTHETICS
*Standardizing terms so the LLM and the Player don't get confused.*

* **Glossary:** (e.g., "What is a 'Shielding Pulse'? What is 'Dissonance'?")
* **Visual Continuity:** How the UI "Rhythm" stays the same while the "Style" changes per app.
